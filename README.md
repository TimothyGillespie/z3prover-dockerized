# z3prover-dockerized
z3 is an automated prover being developed by microsoft: https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3
I needed z3 for my bachelor thesis and thus created this docker image.

This image is being pushed to Docker Hub: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/timothygillespie/z3prover

If you have any improvements to make feel free to fork and make a pull request or drop an issue.
If you wish to have a specific version build feel free to create an issue as well or accommodate yourself by forking or copying the docker file and building it yourself.

Please make sure the z3 license is always contained in the final, distributed image.
